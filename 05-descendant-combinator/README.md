# Descendant Combinator
The goal of this exercise is to apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element, while leaving elements that aren't descendants of that element unstyled.

The properties i need to add:
- Only the p elements that are descendants of the div element should have a yellow background, red text, a font size of 20px, and center aligned.
