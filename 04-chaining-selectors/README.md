# Chaining Selector
In this exercise, i'm learned about chaining selectors. The goal here is to chain the selectors for both elements, so that each have a unique style applied, despite using a shared class selector.

The Properties i need to add for each element are:

- [x] Make the element with both the avatar and proportioned classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).

- [x] Make the element with both the avatar and distorted classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here i should hardcode in a pixel value).
