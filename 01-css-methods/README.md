# Methods for Adding CSS
In this exercise, i'm learning about adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods:
- external CSS
- internal CSS
- Inline CSS

*(tbh, there is no different between the three)

This is all about practicing using these different methods and getting the syntax right.

## Todo List
- [x] div: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold (external css file).
- [x] p: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px (internal).
- [x] button: an orange background and a font size of 18px (inline).
