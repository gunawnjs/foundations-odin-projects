# CSS Selectors
In this exercies, I'm learning about using CSS selectors either using ID or Class. 

The main focus here is to being able to add the attributes and use the correct selector synatax to style elements.


- [x] ~~__All odd numbered elements__: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing Verdana and DejaVu Sans with sans-serif as a fallback.~~

- [x] ~~__The second element__: blue text and a font size of 36px.~~

- [x] ~~__The third element__: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px.~~

- [x] ~~__The fourth element__: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold.~~
