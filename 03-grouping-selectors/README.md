# Grouping Selectors
In this exercise, i create button with separate rules for the styles to each element. 

## Todo List
- [x] __The first element:__ a black background and white text.
- [x] __The second element:__ a yellow background.
- [x] __Both elements:__ a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman, with sans-serif as a fallback.

Since the community doesn't provide any information about what type of color is used __*(HEX, rgba, yellow, black)__, so i'm free to type what i wanted.
